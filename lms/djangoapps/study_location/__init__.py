"""
study_location is a custom app from Appsembler
it provides data and configuration models, views, and 
routes for associating a student with a study location.
This can be a campus, training center, school district,
subsidiary, or other location with which a student should be associated.  
Study locations have an associated email address.  
A ConfigurationModel provides a means to enable the feature
and specify a display override for "study location" appropriate
to the Open edX deployment.
